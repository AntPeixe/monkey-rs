# monkey-rs

An interpreter for the Monkey programming language presented in 
[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

This project will follow the book and is being done with the objective of learning Rust. As a consequence
it is possible that the Rust code isn't the most efficient or clean but that isn't the main focus at the moment.


### Testing

```bash
$ cargo test
```
